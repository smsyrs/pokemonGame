# pokemonGame
This was a pokemon game I worked on as an end of course assignment for my programming with functions class. This was made in about 9 hours

This program does have the added flexibilty of the ability to use different sprites and pokemon. In this case I am only providing the resources to use generation 1 pokemon because of the time necessary to locate all of the different sprites through out the generations. 

In order to make this program I used pygames, bulbapedia.com, https://www.pokencyclopedia.info/en/index.php, and pokemon essentials.

Here are the game instructions: The game will load in a seperate screen, so pull that up. The green is grass meaning that wild pokemon will appear! There are two sets of controls used to play this game: WASD to move and ENTER to throw a pokeball. Keep pressing enter until you get the message that you caught the pokemon. When you are finished playing press the red x on the top right of the screen.

Let me know if you have any issues or requests
